# Aeneas Correspondence Survey

Which Verity items can be put in correspondence with a formal-leanSpec definition or
proposition, and which of those the Charon → Aeneas pipeline turns into Lean today. This is a
measurement, not a plan: every extractability verdict below comes from running the tools on
the real crates at `develop` HEAD, and every correspondence names the two definitions side by
side so a proof author can start from the row.

**Status.** Survey plus one completed correspondence result. No theorem is stated or proved
in this document, and no production Rust was changed to make anything extract. Aeneas remains
a verification aid: the architecture's proof route is still formal-leanSpec compiled through
Lean's C backend ([architecture](https://github.com/NyxFoundation/verity/blob/develop/docs/src/reference/architecture.md)),
and this document does not reopen that. The generated semantics and CONT-2 proofs identified
by Verity PR #49 are now maintained in this repository.

**Read at.** Verity `develop` `dff96ac`; formal-leanSpec `ba72845` (34 catalog propositions in
[`docs/lean4-proof-propositions.md`](https://github.com/NyxFoundation/formal-leanSpec/blob/ba7284513031eac5c66bfb8221d27b6154cf240b/docs/lean4-proof-propositions.md));
leanSpec `08e1481a`; Charon `nightly-2026.09.02`; Aeneas
`nightly-2026.09.03-6852e64` (the pair `cargo-hax` 0.4.0 installs). The extraction branches
this continues are Verity PR #48 (hax) and PR #49 (raw Aeneas); they measured three
`verity-chain` modules at a 2026-09-12 revision. This survey re-measures all 51 modules of six
crates and, where it disagrees with what those branches recorded, says so.

## Method

Three inputs, combined by hand:

1. **Extraction runs.** For every module of `verity-types`, `verity-chain`,
   `verity-validator`, `verity-crypto`, `verity-db`, and `verity-p2p`, Charon was invoked with
   `--start-from <crate>::<module>` and its LLBC handed to Aeneas's Lean backend, one module per
   run. The four IO-shell crates (`verity-node`, `verity-rpc`, `verity-metrics`, `verity`)
   have no formal-leanSpec counterpart and were not run; the two of their items that do
   correspond (the sync state machine and the `BlocksByRange` responder) are read statically
   and marked as such. Commands and the memory discipline they need are in Appendix A.
2. **The Rust inventory**: every `pub` item of the six crates, with the constructs Aeneas is
   known to reject noted per function.
3. **The Lean inventory**: every definition and theorem of formal-leanSpec's 41 files, with the
   catalog ID each theorem discharges.

A refusal is classified as described in [the reproduction guide](reproduction.md): a tool
limitation is recorded and the implementation left alone; only a Verity defect would be fixed.
Every refusal in this survey is a tool limitation.

**Reading the verdicts.** Charon `pass` means the module compiled and reached LLBC; `oom`
means Charon was killed at the memory cap; `fail` means Charon itself panicked. Aeneas `pass`
means no error; `partial` means Aeneas reported errors but still wrote the Lean files, with
each refused function emitted as a `def` whose body is `sorry` (the count is the `sorry`
column); `crash` means Aeneas died on an uncaught exception and wrote nothing. `defs` and
`types` count the `def`s in `Funs.lean` and the `structure`/`inductive`s in `Types.lean`,
including the dependencies each module pulls in from `verity-types` and `libssz`.

Totals: 51 modules; Charon passes 45 (4 killed at the memory cap, 2 panics); of those 45,
Aeneas passes 11 clean, 27 with `sorry` bodies, and crashes on 7.

**What the refusals are made of.** Grouped by cause, because the causes are few:

| Cause | Where | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **`State` / `StateDiff` decoding.** Charon's expansion of the derived `SszDecode` for any type holding `JustificationValidators` (`SszBitlist<2^30>`) grows without bound: 55 GB resident plus 40 GB swap before the kernel killed it uncapped | `verity-types::state`, `verity-db::{diff, read, reconstruct}` (the modules that *decode* those types; `writer`, which only encodes them, passes) | Charon oom |
| **libp2p derive and async swarm.** Charon panics at `src/ast/krate.rs:143` (`Option::unwrap` on `None`) | `verity-p2p::{behaviour, service}` | Charon fail |
| **`Iterator` trait signatures.** Aeneas raises an uncaught `CFailure` in `translate_fun_sigs` on `core::iter::traits::iterator::Iterator` (`impl Iterator` return types, iterator-adaptor chains over `HashMap`/`BTreeMap`) | `verity-chain::{fork_choice, view}`, `verity-validator::aggregation`, `verity-db::backend` | Aeneas crash |
| **`str` pattern APIs.** Same exception on `core::str::pattern` (`strip_prefix`, `split`) | `verity-p2p::gossip`, `verity-crypto::keystore` | Aeneas crash |
| **leanVM's `rec_aggregation` types.** Aeneas's `trait_impl_is_builtin` fails 709 times on Plonky3 trait impls, then crashes | `verity-crypto::aggregate` | Aeneas crash |
| **`libssz` derive-generated decode helpers.** `ssz_decode_fixed_vec` / `fixed_size` closures carry a higher-ranked-to-free lifetime constraint Aeneas has not implemented. The container *types* are unaffected | every `verity-types` container module, `verity-crypto::containers`, `verity-p2p::reqresp` (`Status`) | Aeneas partial |
| **Functions returning `&'static str`.** `as_str`, `name`, `as_bytes`, `file_infix`, `kind`, and every `Display::fmt` come out as `sorry` ("There should be no bottoms in the value" / "Unreachable") | `verity-chain::error`, `verity-db::{column, metadata, error}`, `verity-crypto::scheme`, `verity-validator::product` | Aeneas partial |
| **Closures over map iterators.** `HashSet` dedup closure and `BTreeMap` unpack | `verity-chain::state_transition` (the dedup closure inside `process_attestations_observed`, `JustificationState::unpack`), `verity-chain::block_production` (`select_votes` body ignored; `in_target_slot_order`, `union_of`, `select_proofs_for_coverage`, and the closures inside `trial_body`) | Aeneas partial |
| **Tuple-struct newtypes as root items.** `Slot(pub u64)` gives the type and its constructor one Lean name; Aeneas refuses to register it. Reached as a *dependency* from another module, the same newtype comes out as `def primitives.Slot := Std.U64` | `verity-types::primitives` | Aeneas partial |
| **async and tokio.** Every `async fn` is absent from the output; `tracing` macros and `JoinHandle` produce "could not lookup the translated function" cascades | `verity-validator::{duties, keys}`, `verity-p2p::{wire, reqresp}` (`read_framed`, `read_varint`, the codec) | Aeneas partial |
| **`Box<dyn Error>`** ("Dynamic trait types are not supported yet") | `verity-p2p::wire` (`io::Error` conversions) | Aeneas partial |

**Corrections to PR #48's record.** That branch reported `fork_choice` refused by Charon on
`HashMap`, `state_transition` refused by Aeneas on closures and a non-endable borrow, and
`block_production` refused on a `return` inside a nested loop. At these tool versions and this
revision: `fork_choice` passes Charon and crashes Aeneas on the `Iterator` trait instead;
`state_transition` translates in full but for two `sorry` bodies (the `HashSet` dedup closure
inside `process_attestations_observed` at `attestations.rs:70`, and `JustificationState::unpack`),
so the non-endable borrow is in a dedup step, not in the transition itself; `block_production`
translates `build_block`, `is_eligible`, `extended_chain_view`, and `trial_body`, and refuses
`select_votes`, `in_target_slot_order`, `union_of`, and `select_proofs_for_coverage`. The tool-limit classification stands; the boundary is just much further
in than the branch measured.

## Correspondence by catalog domain

Columns: the formal-leanSpec definition or theorem (with catalog ID), the Verity item that
plays the same role, whether that item's body reached Lean, and what stands between the two
before a theorem could relate them. "Extracts" is per item, from the generated `Funs.lean`:
`body` means a real definition, `sorry` means the signature was emitted and the body refused,
`absent` means Aeneas produced nothing for it.

### SSZ and primitives (SSZ-1 … SSZ-7)

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SSZ.Boolean.encode` / `decode`, `decode_encode` (SSZ-1) | none in Verity; `libssz` (external crate) implements `bool` | not attempted (external) | Verity owns no SSZ codec for primitives |
| `SSZ.Uint64`, `range` (SSZ-2), `encode`/`decode`, `decode_encode`, `encode_size` (SSZ-3) | `verity_types::primitives::{Slot, ValidatorIndex, SubnetId, Interval}` newtypes with hand-written `SszEncode`/`SszDecode` forwarding to `u64` | the forwarding impls: body (149 defs); the newtypes themselves refused as root items (name clash) | Lean `Slot := UInt64` (an alias); Rust `Slot(u64)` (a newtype). From any other module the newtype arrives as `def primitives.Slot := Std.U64`, which is the alias |
| `SSZ.Bytes32`, `size_eq_32` (SSZ-4) | `verity_types::primitives::Bytes32 = [u8; 32]` | body (as `Array U8 32`) | Lean is a subtype of `ByteArray`; Rust a fixed array. Both carry the length in the type |
| `SSZ.SSZVector`, `sszvector_length` (SSZ-5) | `libssz_types::SszVector` (external); used by `verity_crypto::containers::{HashDigest, Parameter, Randomness}` | not attempted (external) | — |
| `SSZ.Utils.getPowerOfTwoCeil`, `ceil_pow2_minimal` (SSZ-6) | none; merkleization lives in `libssz_merkle` | not attempted (external) | — |
| `SSZ.HasHashTreeRoot`, axiom `collisionResistance` (SSZ-7) | `verity_chain::merkle::hash_tree_root<T: HashTreeRoot>` and `verity_db::merkle::hash_tree_root` | body, one trait-method call | The Lean side is an axiom, so the correspondence is "Rust calls the function the axiom is about". Nothing to prove |
| `Forks.Lstar.Errors.STError` (29 constructors) | `verity_chain::error::RejectionReason` (33 variants) | the `inductive`: body; `as_str` and `Display`: sorry | Rust is a strict superset: `StateRootMismatch`, `AnchorStateRootMismatch`, `ValidatorNotInState`, `InvalidSignature` have no Lean constructor. Three are renamed: `invalidSlot` ↔ `BlockSlotMismatch`, `headerSlotNotNewer` ↔ `BlockOlderThanLatestHeader`, `proposerMismatch` ↔ `WrongProposer`. Lean constructors carry payloads (`slotNotInFuture (current target : Slot)`); Rust variants are unit |

### Containers (CONT-1, CONT-2) and configuration

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Checkpoint {root, slot}`, `LT` by slot, `checkpoint_lt_iff_slot_lt` (CONT-1) | `verity_types::checkpoint::Checkpoint {root, slot}` | `structure`: body; derived decode helper: sorry | Rust defines no order on `Checkpoint` (no `PartialOrd`); every comparison in Verity is written out as `a.slot.0 > b.slot.0`. CONT-1 is a statement about the Lean `LT` instance, so its Rust form is a property of `advance_checkpoint`, not of an operator |
| `Checkpoint.advanceTo` | `verity_chain::justification::advance_checkpoint(current, candidate)` | body | Same rule (`candidate.slot > self.slot`), same tie-breaking |
| `Slot.isJustifiableAfter finalized target` (CONT-2: `justifiable_iff`, `justifiable_before_finalized`) | `verity_chain::justification::is_justifiable_after(slot, finalized)` | body, as `RustM Bool`; correspondence proved here | Argument order is swapped. Lean computes on `Nat`; Rust widens to `u128` and returns `RustM Bool`. The handwritten model maps `u128::isqrt` to formal-leanSpec's proved `Slot.isqrt`; `isJustifiableAfter_eq` proves functional equality, `isJustifiableAfter_iff` transfers CONT-2 directly, and `isJustifiableAfter_before_finalized` covers the earlier-slot case. `#print axioms` reports no project-specific axiom, and the proofs contain no `sorry` |
| `Slot.justifiedIndexAfter` | `justification::justified_index_after(slot, finalized)` | body, as `RustM (Option Usize)` | Same order swap; `Nat` vs `usize` |
| `Slot.immediateJustificationWindow = 5` | `justification::IMMEDIATE_JUSTIFICATION_WINDOW = 5` | body (`5#u64`) | — |
| `JustifiedSlots.isSlotJustified` | `justification::is_slot_justified(justified_slots, finalized, slot)` | body, via axiom `SszBitlist.get` | Lean indexes an `Array Bool`; Rust a `SszBitlist<N>` whose `get` is opaque to Aeneas |
| `JustifiedSlots.extendToSlot` | `justification::extend_justified_slots_to` | body, via axioms `SszBitlist.len`/`push`/`clone` | Same bitlist opacity; Rust returns `Result` (capacity), Lean is total |
| `ValidatorIndex.proposerForSlot slot n`, `proposer_index_round_robin` (VAL-1), `unique_proposer` (VAL-3) | `verity_chain::proposer::proposer_for_slot(slot, validator_count) -> Result` | body, as `RustM ValidatorIndex` | Lean takes `0 < n` as a hypothesis; Rust returns `EmptyValidatorRegistry` for 0. Otherwise `slot % n` on both sides. **Second theorem to write** |
| `Interval.fromSlot slot = slot * INTERVALS_PER_SLOT` | `verity_chain::slot_clock::intervals_at_slot_start(slot)` | body, as `RustM Interval` | `RustM` wraps the multiplication |
| `Forks.Lstar.Config`: `MAX_ATTESTATIONS_DATA = 8`, `INTERVALS_PER_SLOT = 5`, `GOSSIP_DISPARITY_INTERVALS = 1`, `HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT = 2^18` | `verity_types::config` (same four values) | body; derived constants come out as `RustM` (`1#usize <<< 18#i32`) | Lean has no `SECONDS_PER_SLOT`, `MILLISECONDS_*`, `JUSTIFICATION_LOOKBACK_SLOTS`, `ATTESTATION_COMMITTEE_COUNT`, `VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_LIMIT`, `JUSTIFICATION_VALIDATORS_LIMIT`, `BYTE_LIST_512_KIB_LIMIT`, `GOSSIP_DIGEST` |
| `Attestation {validatorIndex, data}`, `AggregatedAttestation {aggregationBits, data}` | `verity_types::attestation::{Attestation, AggregatedAttestation}` | `structure`: body; derived decode: sorry | `AggregationBits` is `Array Bool` in Lean, `SszBitlist<VALIDATOR_REGISTRY_LIMIT>` in Rust |
| `AttestationData {slot, head, target, source}`, `liesOnChain` | `verity_types::checkpoint::AttestationData`; `verity_chain::state_transition::attestations::is_on_chain` (`pub(crate)`) | both body | Field order matches |
| `SingleMessageAggregate {participants, proof}` | `verity_types::aggregation::SingleMessageAggregate {participants, proof}` | `structure`: body | Lean `proof : ByteArray`; Rust `ByteList512KiB` |
| `MultiMessageAggregate {payload}` | `verity_types::aggregation::MultiMessageAggregate {proof}` | `structure`: body | **Field name differs**: Lean `payload`, Rust `proof`. leanSpec's container spells it `proof`; the Lean transcription is the odd one out |
| `BlockBody`, `BlockHeader`, `Block`, `SignedBlock {block, proof}` | `verity_types::block::*` | `structure`: body; derived decode: sorry | Field names and order match |
| `GenesisConfig {genesisTime}`, `State` (10 fields) | `verity_types::state::{GenesisConfig, State}` | `State` reaches Lean as a dependency of `verity-chain` (22 types in `state_transition`); as a root module Charon is killed | Field order matches, including the consensus-critical `State` order. The `State` *structure* is fine; its derived decode is what Charon cannot expand |
| `Validator {attestationPublicKey, proposalPublicKey, index}`, `Validators` | `verity_types::validator::{Validator, Validators}` | `structure`: body; derived decode: sorry | Lean keys are `ByteArray`; Rust `Bytes52` |

### State transition (ST-1 … ST-7)

The Lean side lives in `StateTransition.lean`, `Reachable.lean`, `CheckpointForward.lean`, and
`HistoryAlignment.lean`. The Rust side is `verity_chain::state_transition`, which — contrary
to PR #48's record — translates: 75 definitions, two `sorry` bodies, both in the attestation
accounting.

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `State.generateGenesis genesisTime validators` | `state_transition::generate_genesis(genesis_time, validators)` | body | Straight-line; `hash_tree_root` is an axiom on the Lean side |
| `State.processSlots`, `process_slots_advances` (ST-1) | `state_transition::process_slots(state, target_slot) -> Result` | body, as `RustM (Result State RejectionReason)` with the loop split into `process_slots_loop` / `_loop.body` | Lean is total with `termination_by`; the Rust loop becomes Aeneas's `divergent` recursion. ST-1 is provable about the extracted function once `State.clone` (an axiom) is given a body |
| `State.processBlockHeader`, `process_block_header_slot` (ST-2), `transition_header_slot` | `state_transition::process_block_header(state, block)` and private `validate`, `derive_header_checkpoints`, `record_parent_and_skipped_slots` | body (all four) | ST-2 is provable; the `SszList::push` capacity failure is an extra `Err` arm Lean does not have |
| `State.processAttestations`, `JFAcc`, `applyJustification`, `processAttestation`, `rootToSlot`, `noJustifiableBetween`, `unpackJustifications` | `state_transition::attestations::process_attestations_observed` and the private `JustificationState {unpack, apply, counts, justify, rebase_onto, repack}`, `index_chain_by_slot` | body for `process_attestations_observed`, `index_chain_by_slot`, `apply`, `counts`, `justify`, `rebase_onto`, `repack`, `voting_validator_indices`; **sorry** for `unpack` (BTreeMap build) and for the `HashSet` dedup closure inside `process_attestations_observed` (`attestations.rs:70`) | The Lean accumulator is an association list; Rust's is a `BTreeMap` whose operations are axioms (`BTreeMap.entry`, `retain`, `remove`). A refinement needs a map model. `noJustifiableBetween` is the `.all(\|slot\| …)` closure at `attestations.rs:237` and did translate |
| `State.processBlock`, `State.transition`, `state_transition_pure` (ST-5) | `state_transition::{process_block, state_transition}` and the `*_observed` forms | body; the observer generic becomes a typeclass argument `(observeTransitionObserverInst : TransitionObserver T0)` and the result carries the observer back as a pair | ST-5 (purity) is immediate for a Lean `def`. The `Unobserved` instance is a `structure` with a no-op `observe`, so the unobserved wrappers specialise cleanly |
| `State.AnchorWF`, `Reachable`, `anchorWF_of_reachable` | none | — | Meta-level predicates over the Lean model; nothing to extract |
| `checkpoint_monotone` (ST-3), `justified_ge_finalized` (ST-4), `finalization_irreversible` (ST-6), `checkpoint_forward` (ST-7) | properties of `state_transition` | — | Reachable now as theorems about the extracted `state_transition`, gated on the two `sorry`s above and on models for the `BTreeMap` axioms |
| `HistoryAlignment.transition_hist`, `transition_hist_size`, `transition_justified_on_chain` (FC-8 support) | properties of `process_block_header` / `process_attestations` | — | Same |
| `Root.lexLe`, `byteListLe` | none by that name; Rust orders roots with `Ord` on `[u8; 32]` (`lmd_ghost_head`, `latest_votes`) | — | Same order, no named function on the Rust side |

### Fork choice (FC-1 … FC-8)

Lean models the store as association lists (`blocks : List (Root × Block)`); Verity's `Store`
holds `HashMap`s. Aeneas crashes on `verity_chain::fork_choice` and on `view` (both at the
`Iterator` trait, before writing any file), so no row here has an extracted body. Charon passes
both, which PR #48 did not observe.

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Store` structure, `Store.WellFormed` | `fork_choice::store::Store` | crash | Six `HashMap`/`HashSet` fields. `WellFormed` has no Rust mirror yet (the architecture calls for one; see the trust base in [formal verification](https://github.com/NyxFoundation/verity/blob/develop/docs/src/concepts/formal-verification.md)) |
| `getBlock?`, `getState?` | `Store.blocks.get`, `Store.states.get` | crash | `HashMap::get` is an axiom where it does get through (`state_transition` lists it in `FunsExternal`) |
| `ancestorWalk`, `checkpointIsAncestor`, `descendToSlot` | `Store::is_ancestor`, `Store::ancestor_at_slot` | crash | `while let … = map.get(…)` with `return` inside the loop (`ancestor_at_slot`). The same shape in `verity_db::retention::descends_from` translated, so the loop is not the obstacle |
| `validateAttestation`, `attestation_topology` (FC-3) | `fork_choice::attestation::validate_attestation` and its private `validate_{availability,topology,ancestry,timing}` | crash | The checks themselves are straight-line. FC-3 is the natural first fork-choice theorem once the module extracts |
| `computeBlockWeights`, `accumulateAncestorWeights`, `creditChain`, `Weights` | `fork_choice::weights::{ancestor_weights, block_weights}` | crash | `HashMap<Bytes32, u64>` accumulator |
| `extractAttestationsFromAggregatedPayloads`, `votePrecedence` | `weights::{participants, latest_votes}` | `participants` reached Lean via `block_production` as `sorry` (`impl Iterator` return) | The `impl Iterator` return type of `participants` is the likely crash site for the whole module |
| `computeLmdGhostHead`, `ghostWalk`, `maxChild`, `childrenOf`, `beats` | `weights::lmd_ghost_head` | crash | Children map built as `HashMap<Bytes32, Vec<Bytes32>>`; `max_by_key` with a captured closure |
| `updateHead`, `update_head_deterministic` (FC-1), `head_descends_from_justified` (FC-2), `updateHead_wellFormed` (FC-6) | `fork_choice::block::update_head` | crash | Composes the functions above |
| `onBlock`, `applyBlock`, `onBlock_wellFormed` (FC-7), `onBlock_invariants` (FC-8) | `fork_choice::block::on_block_observed` | crash | Also carries the observer generic and `&mut Store` through four callees |
| `BlockProduction.selectionLoop`, `build_block_selection_terminates` (FC-5), `candidateEligible`, `buildBlockAttestations` | `block_production::build_block`, `is_eligible`, private `select_votes` | `build_block`, `is_eligible`, `extended_chain_view`, `trial_body`: body; `select_votes`: body ignored; `in_target_slot_order`, `union_of`, `select_proofs_for_coverage`: sorry | `select_votes` is the fixed-point loop FC-5 is about, and it is exactly the piece that did not come through. `is_eligible` (the Lean `candidateEligible`) did, and is a theorem candidate on its own |
| `Store.prune`, `prune_wellFormed` (#71) | none in `verity-chain` (blocks and states are never pruned in memory); `verity_db::retention::prune_block_proofs` prunes proofs on disk | `prune_block_proofs`: body | Different object: Lean prunes the store below the finalized root, Verity prunes persisted proofs by slot window and prunes votes (`prune_stale_attestation_data`) |
| `PruneHead.updateHead_prune` (#71), `IncrementalWeights` (#67) | none | — | Refinements of the Lean model; no Rust counterpart to relate |
| — | `fork_choice::timeline::{on_tick, accept_new_attestations, update_safe_target}`, `fork_choice::duties::{attestation_target, attestation_data}`, `view::ChainView` | crash | No Lean counterpart: the catalog does not model the interval clock, the safe-target walk, or validator duty derivation |

### Validator (VAL-1 … VAL-5)

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `proposerForSlot`, VAL-1, VAL-3 | `verity_chain::proposer::proposer_for_slot` | body | See the containers table |
| `ValidatorRegistry`, `WellFormed`, `dual_key_distinct` (VAL-2), `addChecked` | `verity_crypto::keystore::load` and its private `load_validator`/`load_role`; `KeyLoadError::{DuplicateRoleKeys, PublicKeyMismatch}` | crash (`str` pattern APIs in the hex decoder) | Rust enforces the check at load time against the manifest; Lean models it as a registry predicate. The Rust path is file IO (`std::fs`, YAML), outside any extractor's subset by design |
| `ValidatorService {attestedSlots}`, `attestationDutyStep`, `pruneAttested`, `ATTESTED_SLOT_RETENTION = 4`, `no_double_vote` (VAL-4) | `verity_validator::duties::DutyService.attested : BTreeSet<Slot>`, private `attest`, the `retain` closure at `duties.rs:317`, private `ATTESTED_SLOT_RETENTION = 4` | `attest`: absent (async); `DutyService`, `LagGate`: types body; 28 `sorry`s from `tracing` and closures | The gate itself (`contains` → skip, `insert` after send, `retain` on the retention window) is four lines inside an async method. It is the clearest case of a provable rule buried in IO; lifting it into a pure function would make VAL-4 extractable without changing behaviour |
| `Xmss.SecretKey`, `Scheme.preparedEnd`, `advancePreparation`, `advancePreparation_monotone` (VAL-5) | `verity_crypto::key::SecretKey::{prepared_interval, advance_preparation, advance_preparation_to}` | body (all three, including the `return`-inside-`loop` in `advance_preparation_to`); only `Debug::fmt` is `sorry` | The window arithmetic Lean proves monotone is inside leanSig, which Aeneas sees as opaque axioms (`XmssSecretKey` methods). VAL-5 about Verity code reduces to "Verity calls `advance_preparation` and forwards the interval", which is what extracted |
| `Validator/Service.attestationDue` | `DutyService::serves_duties` / private `LagGate::admits` | absent / sorry | Different rule: Lean gates on `synced`; Verity gates on lag hysteresis and a network-stall threshold. Not a correspondence, a divergence to record |
| `sign` / `verify` (not catalogued; the signature boundary) | `verity_crypto::signature::{sign, verify}` | body, as calls to leanSig axioms | The scheme is opaque to Aeneas, so nothing about signatures is provable about Verity alone |

### Networking (NET-1, NET-2)

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Networking.Config`: `MAX_REQUEST_BLOCKS = 2^10`, `MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 10 MiB`, `MIN_SLOTS_FOR_BLOCK_REQUESTS = 3600` | `verity_p2p::config` (same three values); `verity_db::retention::MIN_SLOTS_FOR_BLOCK_REQUESTS` (duplicate) | body | Rust also has `MAX_ERROR_MESSAGE_SIZE`, `RESP_TIMEOUT`, `MESSAGE_DOMAIN_*` with no Lean counterpart |
| `BlocksByRangeRequest {startSlot, count}`, `ResponseCode` (4 constructors) | `verity_p2p::reqresp::messages::{BlocksByRangeRequest, ErrorCode (3 variants) + RESPONSE_CODE_SUCCESS}`, `ErrorCode::{as_byte, from_byte}` | `structure`/`inductive`: body; `as_byte`, `from_byte`: body; derived `Eq` on the request: sorry | Lean folds `success` into the enum; Rust keeps it as a byte constant. `from_byte`'s range classification (`4..=127 → ServerError`, `128..=255 → InvalidRequest`) is a theorem candidate against leanSpec's codec |
| `handleBlocksByRange`, `blocks_by_range_bounded` (NET-1) | `verity_node::sync::responder::serve_range` (private; not in the surveyed crates) with `verity_db::retention::{can_serve_range, range_service_floor}` | not run (`verity-node`); `can_serve_range`, `range_service_floor`: body | The Lean function takes a lookup closure and returns `Except`; Rust reads through `Repository<B>`. NET-1's bound (`resp.length ≤ min count MAX_REQUEST_BLOCKS`) holds by the `count` check at `responder.rs:156` plus the range bound; it is provable about `serve_range` only after the repository is modelled |
| `readRequest`, `payload_size_bound` (NET-2), `compressed_size_bound` | `verity_p2p::wire::snappy::{decompress_block(max), read_framed}`, private `reqresp::codec::read_chunk_payload` | absent (async, and `decompress_block` behind `Box<dyn Error>` conversions) | The size checks are the same shape (declared length ≤ max before decompressing) |
| `Allocation.varintSize`, `MAX_LENGTH_PREFIX_SIZE = 4`, `varintSize_le_prefix_bound` | `verity_p2p::wire::varint::{write_varint, read_varint, decode_varint}`, `MAX_VARINT_LEN = 10` | `write_varint`: body (with its `return` inside `loop`); `decode_varint`: sorry; `read_varint`: absent (async) | Lean proves a 4-byte prefix suffices for payloads ≤ 10 MiB; Rust accepts up to 10 bytes (the LEB128 maximum for `u64`). Consistent, not identical. `write_varint` against `varintSize` is a theorem candidate |
| `Allocation.MAX_COMPRESSED_PAYLOAD_SIZE = MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE + MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE / 6 + 1024` | `verity_p2p::config::max_compressed_len(u) = 32 + u + u / 6` | body | **Formulas differ.** Both bound snappy output; Rust's is the library's documented `max_compress_len`, Lean's adds 1024 slack. At 10 MiB Lean allows 992 bytes more. Neither is derived from leanSpec (Lean's file says so); worth aligning one to the other |

### Storage (STOR-1, STOR-2)

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Storage.insertBlock` (parent-gated), `parentsPresent_insertBlock`, `parent_exists_or_genesis` (STOR-1) | the `UnknownParentBlock` check in `fork_choice::block::on_block_observed`; `verity_db::writer::check_block` (`ParentMismatch`) | `on_block_observed`: crash; `check_block`: sorry (its `Display`-bearing error path) | Lean states the gate on the store; Verity has it twice, once in memory and once at commit |
| `insertBlock_slot_gap_bounded` (#1171: gap ≤ `HISTORICAL_ROOTS_LIMIT`) | the `BlockSlotGapTooLarge` check in `on_block_observed` | crash | Same bound |
| `Database`, `Write`, `batchWrite`, `batch_write_commits`, `batch_atomic` (STOR-2) | `verity_db::backend::{WriteBatch, Op, StorageBackend::write}`, `Repository::commit`; `MemoryBackend::write` (sequential `apply`), `RocksBackend::write` (RocksDB `WriteBatch`) | crash (`backend`; the `BTreeMap` range iterators) | Lean's `batchWrite` is all-or-nothing by construction; `MemoryBackend` applies ops one by one with no failure path, `RocksBackend` delegates atomicity to RocksDB. STOR-2 about `MemoryBackend` needs the `BTreeMap` iterator crash resolved; about RocksDB it is a trust assumption |
| `Database.get?`, `put`, `get?_put_self`, `get?_put_ne` | `StorageReader::get`, `MemoryBackend::apply` (`Op::Put`) | crash | Same module |
| `votePrecedence` (fork choice, used by `Weights`) | `verity_db::votes::replaces(candidate, stored)` | body | Newer slot wins, tie broken by larger `hash_tree_root`; a small theorem candidate against the Lean precedence |
| — | `verity_db::writer::{canonical_switch, ancestry_to_canonical, queue_canonical_switch, queue_vote_merge, commit_tick, record_pending_votes}`, `retention::{prune_block_proofs, vote_is_relevant, descends_from}`, `key::*`, `schema::Identity`, `column::ColumnFamily` | body (the `&'static str` helpers and `ssz_schema_digest` are `sorry`) | No Lean counterpart; the catalog models storage as a key-value list and nothing more. These extract but have nothing to be related to |

### Sync (SYNC-1, SYNC-2)

Both Verity items live in `verity-node` (`src/sync/state.rs`), outside the extraction runs;
verdicts are static.

| formal-leanSpec | Verity | Extracts | Obstacle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SyncState {idle, syncing, synced}` | `verity_node::sync::state::SyncState {Idle, Syncing, Synced}` | not run; plain enum | — |
| `canTransitionTo` (4 rules), `transitionTo`, `transition_sound` (SYNC-1) | `SyncMachine::observe(head_slot, network_finalized)` | not run; a `match` on `(Option<SyncState>, bool)` with `tracing` inside | Verity takes three of the four Lean transitions (`idle→syncing`, `syncing→synced`, `synced→syncing`) and never returns to `idle`. That is a subset, so SYNC-1 holds; the state is `Option<SyncState>` with `None` read as `Idle`, and the transition is driven by an observation, not requested |
| `acceptsGossip`, `accepts_gossip_iff` (SYNC-2) | none | — | **Verity does not gate gossip on the sync state.** `verity_node::network` forwards every `NetworkEvent::Gossip`; the `synced` watch (`SyncState::is_caught_up`, true only in `Synced`) gates validator duties instead. SYNC-2 has no Verity counterpart to relate |

## Divergences worth acting on

Found while aligning the two sides. None is an extraction concern; each is a place where the
Rust and the Lean say different things, which is what a correspondence table exists to surface.

1. **`MultiMessageAggregate` field name.** formal-leanSpec spells it `payload`; leanSpec
   (`08e1481a`) and Verity spell it `proof`. Report to formal-leanSpec.
2. **Compressed-size bound.** `verity_p2p::config::max_compressed_len` and formal-leanSpec's
   `MAX_COMPRESSED_PAYLOAD_SIZE` use different formulas (32 + n + n/6 versus n + n/6 + 1024).
   Neither is from leanSpec. Pick one.
3. **Gossip is not gated by sync state.** SYNC-2 says gossip is accepted only in
   `syncing`/`synced`; Verity accepts it in every state. `Idle` lasts only until the first peer
   status, so the window is small, but the property is unprovable as things stand.
4. **`RejectionReason` is a superset of `STError`** by four variants, and three names differ.
   Any refinement of the state transition has to map errors, not equate them.
5. **Duty gate rule.** Lean's `attestationDue` gates on `synced`; Verity's `LagGate` gates on
   lag hysteresis and a stall threshold. Different rule, deliberately (see the `duties.rs`
   module doc); the catalog's VAL-4 is about double voting and is unaffected.

## What this settles

- **The state transition extracts.** `generate_genesis`, `process_slots`,
  `process_block_header`, `process_attestations_observed`, `process_block`, and
  `state_transition` all have Lean bodies; the two `sorry`s are the `BTreeMap` unpack and the
  `HashSet` dedup closure in the attestation loop. ST-1, ST-2, and ST-5 are statable about the extracted
  definitions now; ST-3/4/6/7 need models for the `BTreeMap` axioms first. This reverses the
  most consequential line in PR #48's record.
- **The first correspondence is complete in this repository.** `isJustifiableAfter_eq`
  proves that the extracted `RustM Bool` equals `LeanSpec.Slot.isJustifiableAfter` under
  `finalized ≤ slot`; `isJustifiableAfter_iff` transfers CONT-2's direct characterization; and
  `isJustifiableAfter_before_finalized` proves that an earlier slot returns `ok false`. The
  handwritten external model replaces Aeneas's `u128::isqrt` axiom with formal-leanSpec's proved
  `Slot.isqrt`; none of the three theorems depends on a project-specific axiom or `sorry`. The
  next clean correspondence is `proposer_for_slot` against `LeanSpec.ValidatorIndex.proposerForSlot`
  (VAL-1/VAL-3). Smaller candidates with the same property are `advance_checkpoint` against
  `Checkpoint.advanceTo`, `is_eligible` against `candidateEligible`, `votes::replaces` against
  `votePrecedence`, `ErrorCode::from_byte` against leanSpec's codec, and `write_varint` against
  `varintSize`.
- **Every consensus container extracts as a type.** The `verity-types` refusals are entirely
  the `libssz` derive's decode closures. A container-shape correspondence (field names, order,
  widths) is checkable in Lean today, and the rows above already record the two mismatches it
  would find.
- **Fork choice is blocked by one Aeneas crash, not by `HashMap`.** Charon now passes the
  module; Aeneas dies translating the `Iterator` trait signature (the `impl Iterator` return of
  `participants` is the likely trigger). That is an upstream Aeneas issue to file, with the
  `verity-chain.fork_choice` LLBC as the reproducer, and it also blocks `view`,
  `verity-validator::aggregation`, and `verity-db::backend`.
- **Two memory hazards are Verity-shaped, not tool-shaped.** Charon cannot expand the derived
  decode of any type holding `JustificationValidators` (`SszBitlist<2^30>`); it consumed 55 GB
  plus 40 GB of swap and took the host down with it before the runs were capped. Run Charon
  under a memory limit (Appendix A). Aeneas separately needs more than 12 GB on `verity-types::block`
  alone (it passes at 40 GB), so parallel runs need headroom.
- **VAL-4 is the one rule that could be made extractable by a refactor with no behaviour
  change**: the attested-slot gate is four pure lines inside an async method.
- **Nothing here changes the architecture.** The catalog's FC-* theorems stay reachable only
  through formal-leanSpec's own definitions compiled via the C backend; the ST-\* theorems now
  have a second, Aeneas-side route that this survey did not take.

## Appendix A: reproduction

Tools are the ones `cargo hax tools install` (cargo-hax 0.4.0) places under
`~/.cache/hax/tools`. From a checkout at `dff96ac`:

```sh
CHARON=~/.cache/hax/tools/charon/nightly-2026.09.02/charon
AENEAS=~/.cache/hax/tools/aeneas/nightly-2026.09.03-6852e64/aeneas
cd crates/verity-chain
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=16G \
  "$CHARON" cargo --preset=aeneas --dest-file /tmp/out.llbc --start-from verity_chain::justification
systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=40G \
  "$AENEAS" -backend lean -dest /tmp/out -split-files /tmp/out.llbc
```

Substitute the crate directory and `<crate>::<module>` for each row of the results table.

- **Always cap Charon.** Uncapped, `--start-from verity_types::state` (and `verity_db::{diff,
  read, reconstruct}`) grows past physical memory and the kernel OOM killer takes unrelated
  processes with it. With `MemoryMax` the kill stays inside the scope and the module is simply
  recorded as `oom`.
- **Run Aeneas one module per invocation.** A crate-wide `--start-from` list is not a
  shortcut: one crashing module (`fork_choice`) aborts Aeneas before it writes anything for the
  others.
- Charon builds through cargo, so parallel Charon runs serialize on the build-directory lock;
  Aeneas runs are independent but each can need well over 12 GB, so five in parallel on a 60 GB
  host is the practical ceiling. Charon's own compile of `verity-crypto` and `verity-p2p` pulls
  leanVM/Plonky3 and libp2p respectively and takes several minutes each on first run.
- Aeneas leaves refused bodies as `def … := do sorry`, so `grep -c '^  sorry' Funs.lean` is the
  per-module refusal count, and the `[Error] … Source:` lines in its log name the Rust item.
